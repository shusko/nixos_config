# My NixOS Config

A pretty basic NixOS setup.

## Installation

After running a NixOS installer to generate the initial `/etc/nixos/`, symlink
the files from this repo to instantiate the system.

Copy the hardware configuration generated by NixOS to this location
`sudo cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix $(pwd)/hardware-configuration.nix`
`sudo chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) .`

If your hardware has changed since last install, you will need to
`git add hardware-configuration.nix`. Don't commit yet.

Symlink all /etc/nixos/ to this repo
`sudo rm -r /etc/nixos && sudo ln -s $(pwd) /etc/nixos`

Build with
`sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake $(pwd)`

Optionally commit your hardware and push to update the repo


## TODO:
- [ ] Figure out how to support multiple hosts and hardware configurations
    - [ ] Redo README with install instructions for new host machine
